# TursoSync

## 1.1.0
### Minor Changes

- Surface lock contention as `TursoException.IsBusy` so callers can tell a retryable busy from a real error.
  
  `Check` threw on the engine's error pointer *before* looking at the status code, so a `Busy` result was
  reported as a plain message with the status discarded — leaving string-matching on "database is locked" as
  the only way to classify it. The status is now carried on the exception in both branches.
  
  `IsBusy` and `IsBusySnapshot` are deliberately mutually exclusive. The engine treats them as different
  failures: plain `Busy` is lock contention worth retrying, while `BusySnapshot` means a checkpoint advanced the
  WAL and the read snapshot is permanently stale — "Retrying with busy_timeout will NEVER HELP", the transaction
  has to be rolled back and restarted. Both are also matched on message text, because contention sometimes
  arrives with a generic status and an explanatory string rather than the dedicated code.
  
  This does not retry anything. A concurrent checkpoint currently fails statements outright rather than making
  them wait: measured with one writer and a checkpoint every 100 ms, a contended `prepare_single` fails in ~3
  microseconds (median) whether the connection's busy timeout is 200 ms or 5000 ms — 25x the budget, identical
  time-to-failure — so the engine's busy handler is not consulted on that path. Without a checkpoint running,
  a concurrent writer produces no contention failures at all. `TursoBusyTimeoutTests` pins this so that a fix
  in the engine flips the assertion.
  
  A managed retry loop was tried and reverted: waiting out the busy means holding native statement state across
  a live checkpoint, and the workload stops draining entirely (a 3-second probe arm ran indefinitely at 165%
  CPU, versus 3.0 s with retry off). The rationale is recorded in `TursoRawConnection` so it is not
  reintroduced. The real fix belongs in the engine, next to the lock it needs to wait on.
  
- Typed error kinds, a normalized pool key, a configurable idle cap, and leak visibility.
  
  `TursoException.Kind` (`TursoErrorKind`) exposes the engine's own classification — `Constraint`, `ReadOnly`,
  `DatabaseFull`, `Corrupt`, `NotADatabase`, `Io`, `Interrupted`, `Busy`, `BusySnapshot` — so a caller can tell a
  unique-key violation from a real fault without matching on message text. `IsBusy`/`IsBusySnapshot` are now
  derived from it.
  
  Physical connections are pooled under a key built from the PARSED connection string rather than its raw text.
  The base builder normalizes keywords but not values, so `Sync=true` and `SYNC=True` previously keyed two
  separate pools for one connection, each keeping its own idle set; paths are resolved to full paths for the
  same reason. Only settings that make two connections non-interchangeable are part of the key.
  
  `Max Idle Connections` (aliases: `MaxIdleConnections`, `Max Pool Size`, `MaxPoolSize`) makes the per-key idle
  cap configurable, defaulting to the previous hard-coded 4.
  
  Renting no longer re-runs the health probe on a connection returned within the last second — it was proven
  healthy on the way in, and the probe is a full round trip on every checkout for consumers that open a
  connection per operation.
  
  `TursoConnection.OpenReplicas` lists the replicas currently held open and how many connections hold each. One
  sync engine is shared per replica and lives until its last connection is disposed, so a connection that is
  never closed pins its replica for the life of the process and no amount of `ClearPool()` will release its
  files; asserting this list is empty at shutdown catches that.
  

### Patch Changes

- Fix a connection-pool leak, and stop treating lock contention as a dead connection.
  
  `Rent` dequeued an idle connection and, if the health probe rejected it, returned it to nobody — the
  connection was dropped without being disposed. That always leaked the native connection; with connections now
  sharing a sync engine per replica it also leaked the engine reference, so the refcount never reached zero, the
  replica's files stayed open for the life of the process, and `ClearPool()` could no longer release them for
  `RemoteAttach` to move. `Rent` now disposes rejected connections and keeps draining the queue instead of
  falling straight through to opening a new one.
  
  `IsUsable` treated every exception as a dead connection, including `database is locked`. A checkpoint fails
  concurrent statements — the probe included — so the whole pool was discarded and rebuilt at exactly the moment
  it was most contended, against an engine that was still busy. Contention (`IsBusy`/`IsBusySnapshot`) now
  counts as healthy; only real failures retire a connection.
  
- Share one sync engine per replica file set instead of creating one per connection.
  
  `TursoPhysicalConnection.Create` called `TursoSyncDatabase.Create` for every physical connection, so a pool
  holding up to `MaxIdlePerKey` connections ran that many independent sync engines over a single replica — each
  owning and fragmenting the same WAL. Connections now acquire a reference-counted, shared engine
  (`TursoSyncDatabaseCache`) and open over it via `TursoSyncDatabase.Connect`, which is what that API is for.
  The engine is disposed when its last connection goes, so pooled connections keep it warm and `ClearPool()`
  still releases the replica's file handles.
  
  Measured against a live remote on a 13.8 MB WAL under 25 s of 4-way concurrent load with a checkpoint/push
  loop underneath. Engine per connection: 10,626 statements, 745,096 errors, 86 failed checkpoints, and
  `sync_database_create ... database tape error: database is busy` — connections that could not be opened at
  all while another engine was active. Shared engine, same load through the ADO.NET surface: 10,260 statements,
  125 errors, zero failed checkpoints, and no open-time failures whatsoever.
  
  Opening a replica against a different remote than the one it is already open against is now rejected with a
  clear error rather than silently handed an engine bound elsewhere.
  

## 1.0.1

## 1.0.0
### Minor Changes

- Add TursoSyncConfig.PullBytesThreshold to chunk the initial bootstrap download into multiple /pull-updates requests (0 = single round-trip, the default). Useful for large remote databases.

### Patch Changes

- Fix remote sync against Turso Cloud: zero-length request bodies (e.g. the initial /pull-updates protobuf, which encodes to no bytes) are now sent with their content-type and Content-Length: 0, so Cloud no longer rejects the bootstrap with HTTP 400. Bundled Turso engine bumped to v0.7.0.

### Breaking

- BREAKING: move public types from namespace Turso to Turso.Sync so the package coexists with the official Turso.Data.Sqlite (which owns namespace Turso). Update 'using Turso;' to 'using Turso.Sync;'. Also rename the live-test env vars TWEED_TURSO_SYNC_URL/TOKEN to TURSOSYNC_SYNC_URL/TOKEN.

## 0.1.0
### 🩹 Fixes

- Fix enumerating a TursoDataReader (foreach / DbEnumerator): GetDataTypeName no longer throws InvalidEnumArgumentException on the Unknown value kind (which occurs while building schema before the first row); it now falls back to the declared column type.
- Reject local at-rest encryption on the sync engine: TursoSyncDatabase.Create now throws NotSupportedException when an EncryptionCipher is set, instead of silently producing a synced database that cannot be reopened ("Decryption failed for page=1"). Local at-rest encryption remains supported on the base (local-only) lane via OpenLocal. Turso Cloud server-side encryption (remote key) is unaffected.
