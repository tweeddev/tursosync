/// <para><b>Why.</b> A sync database owns its replica's WAL — it fragments it, rewinds it to a watermark on a
/// pull-side revert, and truncates it on checkpoint. Standing up a second engine over the same files gives
/// that file set two owners with independent views. Measured against a live remote under 4-way concurrent
/// load (see <c>TursoWalSharingTests</c>): an engine per connection produced 745k errors and 86 failed
/// checkpoints, including <c>sync_database_create ... database tape error: database is busy</c> — engines
/// that could not be opened at all while another was active. One shared engine over the same load: the same
/// statement throughput, a third of the errors, zero failed checkpoints, and the busy class gone entirely.</para>
///
/// <para>The engine is designed for this — <see cref="TursoSyncDatabase.Connect"/> exists to hand out
/// connections, and the class guards its own operations behind an internal lock. Entries are reference
/// counted by live <see cref="TursoPhysicalConnection"/>s (including idle pooled ones, so a pooled connection
/// keeps the engine warm and avoids re-paying the bootstrap); the engine is disposed when the last one goes,
/// which is what releases the replica's file handles for <c>RemoteAttach</c>.</para>
